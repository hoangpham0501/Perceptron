# Machine Learning Classifiers Using Scikit-learn
## Choosing a classification algorithm
The five main steps that are involved in training a machine learning algorithm can be summarized as follows:
### Selection of features
### Choosing a performance metric
### Choosing a classifier and optimization algorithm
### Evaluating the performance of the model
### Tuning the algorithm
## First steps with scikit-learn
Related learning algorithms for classification: the **perceptron** rule and **Adaline**.
The scikit-learn library offers not only a large variety of learning algorithms, but also many convenient functions to preprocess data and to fine-tune and evaluate our models.
##Training a perceptron via scikit-learn (using Iris dataset)**
**Note:** The perceptron algorithm never converges on datasets that aren't perfectly linearly separable, which is why the use of the perceptron algorithm is typically not recommended in practice.
